# Companion App for Sparsh - Enhancing Tactile Feedback For Virtual Keyboard

Sparsh is a tactile feedback device (smartphone casing), which improves upon the user experience of typing on a smartphone keyboard by providing distinct vibration feedback for every single key. 

Using this we hope to develop a learning tool for children with autism, where the device will assist them in learning the English alphabet and words. Because children with autism have heightened senses, it helps them map the distinct vibration feedback with the letter and understand them better.

We propose a device which fits over smartphones of various shapes and sizes, using its stretch elastic edges. The mechanism to produce different vibration is part of the case. A learning app to help children learn basic alphabets and words is expected to be used while the case is on the smartphone. When the child taps on a letter on the screen, she/he can hear the sound of the alphabet with the corresponding word, and at the same time feel a vibration in the casing. 

As proven by research, engaging children with autism using sensory inputs can help them learn better. We build upon this fact and propose this device as our solution.
